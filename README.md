## ðŸ§© 1. Personal Finance Planner

In this section of the challenge, you will create a personal finance planner application. To develop the personal finance planner prototype, you should take into account the following assumptions:

* The average household income for each member of the credit union is $12,000.
    * Assume the following amount of crypto assets: `1.2` BTC and `5.3` ETH.
    * Collect Crypto Prices Using the `requests` Library
    * Create two variables called `my_btc` and `my_eth`. Set them equal to `1.2` and `5.3`, respectively.
    * Use the `requests` library to fetch the current price in US dollars (`USD`) of bitcoin (`BTC`) and ethereum (`ETH`) using Alternative Free Crypto API.
    * Parse the API JSON response to select only the crypto prices and store each price in a variable.
        * Be aware of the particular identifier for each cryptocurrency in the API JSON response - the bitcoin identifier is `1` whereas ethereum is `1027`.
    * Compute the portfolio value of cryptocurrencies and print the results.
    * Collect Investments Data Using Alpaca: `SPY` (stocks) and `AGG` (bonds) 
    * Remember to create a `.env` file in your working directory to store the values of your Alpaca API key and Alpaca secret key.
    * Create two variables named `my_agg` and `my_spy` and set them equal to `200` and `50`, respectively.
    * Set the Alpaca API key and secret key variables, then create the Alpaca API object using the `tradeapi.REST` function from the Alpaca SDK.
    * Format the current date as ISO format. You may change the date set in the starter code to the current date.
    * Get the current closing prices for `SPY` and `AGG` using Alpaca's `get_bars()` function. Transform the function's response to a Pandas DataFrame and preview the data.
    * Pick the `SPY` and `AGG` close prices from the Alpaca's `get_bars()` DataFrame response and store them as Python variables. Print the closing values for validation.
    * Compute the value in dollars of the current amount of shares and print the results.

* Savings Health Analysis
    * In this section, you will assess the financial health of the credit union's members.

        * Create a variable called `monthly_income` and set its value to `12000`.
        * To analyze savings health, create a DataFrame called `df_savings` with two rows. Store the total value in dollars of the crypto assets in the first row and the total value of the shares in the second row.
        * The `df_savings` DataFrame should have one column named `amount` and two rows where `crypto` and `shares` are the index values:
        * Use the `df_savings` DataFrame to plot a pie chart to visualize the composition of personal savings.
        * Use `if` conditional statements to validate if the current savings are enough for an emergency fund. An ideal emergency fund should be equal to three times your monthly income.
        * If total savings are greater than the emergency fund, display a message congratulating the person for having enough money in this fund.
        * If total savings are equal to the emergency fund, display a message congratulating the person on reaching this financial goal.
        * If total savings are less than the emergency fund, display a message showing how many dollars away the person is from reaching the goal.

## ðŸŽ° 2. Retirement Planning

* In this section, you will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio and then Use the MCForecastTools toolkit to create Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at `30` years. 
* You will then use the Monte Carlo data to answer questions about the portfolio.

* Monte Carlo Simulation

    * Use the Alpaca API to fetch five years historical closing prices for a traditional `40/60` portfolio using the `SPY` and `AGG` tickers to represent the `60%` stocks (`SPY`) and `40%` bonds (`AGG`) composition of the portfolio. Make sure to convert the API output to a DataFrame and preview the output.
        * *Note*: In Monte-Carlo Simulation, getting data as far back as possible matters, because if we simulate using only small amounts of data during a recent time when markets are booming, or instead falling precipitously, a Monte-Carlo Analysis will inadvertently extrapolate this temporary market movement too far into the future. Getting data over a longer time period mitigates this effect.

    * Configure and execute a Monte Carlo Simulation of `500` runs and `30` years for the `40/60` portfolio.

    * Plot the simulation results and the probability distribution/confidence intervals.

* Retirement Analysis
    * Fetch the summary statistics from the Monte Carlo simulation results.
    * Given an initial investment of `$20,000`, calculate the expected portfolio return in dollars at the `95%` lower and upper confidence intervals.
    * Calculate the expected portfolio return at the `95%` lower and upper confidence intervals based on a `50%` increase in the initial investment.

## ðŸŽ² 3. Early Retirement

* The CTO of the Credit Union was really impressed with your work on this planner, but commented that `30` years seems like such a long time to wait to retire! 
*  The CTO starts wondering if the retirement plan could be adjusted to account for an earlier than normal retirement.
    * Try adjusting the portfolio to either include more risk (a higher stock than bond ratio) or to have a larger initial investment and rerun the retirement analysis to see what it would take to retire in `5` or `10` years instead of `30`!
